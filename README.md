# multiscreen-cursor-control
* Tracks the distance of the face to the webcam.
* According to the distance the cursor switches to one or the other screen.
* You can change the criterion to switch the screen. This criterion just worked fine for me.
* This script is meant to make working on multiple screen more comfortable. However, it might use too much of your PC's resources.
